#summary Features that are intended to be present in next product release.

= Introduction =
This page contains a list of the features that are desired for the upcoming release. This page will grow and periodically be trimmed as the project evolves, but should avoid feature creep as much as possible. _(Before adding a feature, think clearly about what value the feature will add to the end-user experience and what need has already been demonstrated by users for that feature; if a feature merely "sounds cool", it probably isn't needed.)_

= Target Release =
Currently, the features listed here are slated for the *0.5a* release.

= Feature List =
== High Priority ==
  * *Intelligent Scheduling* - This is a PVR application; this is kind of a no-brainer.
  * *Remote Support (via LIRC)* - ... see above. LIRC already supports a wide variety of remotes.
  * *Fault-tolerance on back-end, especially around JNI invocations* - The back-end must stay up under almost all circumstances, except for perhaps incorrectly-configured hardware. Otherwise, recordings may be missed. VLC will be the weak spot here because it is written in C, so segmentation faults, floating-point exceptions, and illegal instructions are possible.
  * *DataDirect Listings Support* - This is the most prevalent listings provider for North America; we need to support it.
  * *Normalized, Clear-cut Database Structure* - The main design principle for the database is write once, reference many. In other words, no redundant information; it gets out of sync too easily. The database design must ultimately be as normalized as reasonably possible.
  * *Java3D Interface* - The user base will most likely have a card with GL support, so we should take advantage of it. This avoids the use of Swing, SWT, or AWT all together, while at the same time bringing performance and simplicity to video playback (we don't have to handle mode switching in/out of OpenGL, SWT/Swing/AWT painting wierdness, etc).
  * *VLC Integration* - The application must make use of VLC for recording and playback of streams. VLC's existing capabilities should be exploited where-ever possible, so we can avoid re-inventing the wheel. Why write a new player, when VLC already supports so many formats and has preliminary support for HD and analog tuner cards?

== Normal Priority ==
  * *SSDP for Backend Discovery* - Front-ends should be capable of discovering each other via Simple Server Discovery Protocol, so users do not have to remember IP addresses. Although the protocol does not traverse firewalls well, this should not pose a problem for the typical operating environment (LAN, home setup).
  * *Step-by-step / wizard based first-run setup* - MythTV, lirc, ivtv, and dvb are very complicated to setup at the moment. LegendTV should NOT be that difficult -- users should be able to install and go, without having to fiddle with IP addresses, hardware device paths, etc. The target audience is NOT the experienced Linux sys admin -- most PVR boxes will be serving the single function of a set-top box, so why assume that the user is an IT admin?
  * *Quake-like input binding support* - Users should be able to configure keys / remote buttons the same way a Quake player would -- select an action, press a button, done! The user should not need a special plugin or external config file to do this.
  * *T9 / Numeric Input Support* - The user will most likely be controlling the system via a remote; as a result, most PVR applications attempt to present the user with an on-screen keyboard that they have to tediously navigate back and forth to input text. Instead, we should look at the remote just like a cell phone -- it has 10 digits (0-9), so we should support having the user press a number a certain number of times to pertain to a particular digit (eg. B is 2 twice). If we implement T9, we can auto-complete the user's input based on the unique sequence of keys for particular words, and then learn the words we don't know.
  * *Most features supported by MythTV* - There are many features that MythTV provides that we must provide as well. These are too numerous to name here, but include things like LCD support, flexible scheduling options, etc.

== Low Priority ==
  * *Multi-user support for recordings* - Different users in the home have different tastes. Some users might have the same tastes, but watch programs at different times. Users should be allowed to schedule what they want to record without having to see other users' recordings, and be able to delete recordings they've watched without affecting the recordings of other users. Our software may be the first to support this feature.
  * *OpenGL XvMC Support* - The MythTV developers have played with this, but AFAIK it has not been implemented; this is required for the feature below.
  * *Hardware De-interlace (GPU Only)* - Currently, XvMC supports only BOB de-interlace, or no de-interlacing at all, which is completely unacceptable for HD content. If we can use OpenGL with XvMC texturing, we may be able to do de-interlacing in hardware on the GPU using shader scripts. This would seriously reduce the load on the CPU when HD content is being played back, while at the same time allow us utilize XvMC capabilities in newer cards and produce a high quality picture in the process.
