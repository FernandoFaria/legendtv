= Introduction =
The LegendTV project is based on an iterative development model. Thus, rather than trying to implement all the features we want at once, we will instead start with the most basic of features, implement those for the first release, and then implement subsequent features in future iterations that will produce additional releases. This document is an outline of what types of features we aim to have in each release.
